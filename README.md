An effort to test various annealers for nexpnr.


Default hyperparameter annelars (commonly used for ML tasks) tested here:

  * https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive
  * https://github.com/optuna/optuna
  * https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt
  
Future goal:

  Elaborate early (detect early nextpnr activity) features and encode them in a feature vector to generate a cost model (prefferably xgboost) and early fit/estimate/predict best combinatoric parameter set.
